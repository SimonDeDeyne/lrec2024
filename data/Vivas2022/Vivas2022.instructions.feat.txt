You will be presented with a list of word pairs consisting of a cue and a semantic feature separated by ' – '.

You are asked to choose a code with square brackets [] that best describes the semantic relation between the cue and the semantic feature.
Each code refers to a specific semantic relation that refers to Taxonomic Categories, Entity Properties, Situation Properties, or Introspective Properties.

We will now provide you with a definition and example for each of these, which you will carefully consider when choosing one of the codes.
In these examples, the relation signified by the semantic feature is higlighted by using capitalized letters.

Taxonomic Categories: A category in the taxonomy to which a concept belongs.
- *Synonym [T-SYN]*: A synonym of a concept. Examples: car – AUTOMOBILE; cat – FELINE.
- *Ontological category [T-ONT]. A category for a basic kind of thing in existence, including thing, substance, object, human, animal, plant, location, time, activity, event, action, state, thought, emotion. Examples: cat – ANIMAL; computer – OBJECT.
- *Superordinate [T-SUPER]*: A category one level above a concept in a taxonomy. Examples: car – VEHICLE; apple – FRUIT.
- *Coordinate [T-COORD]*: Another category in the superordinate category to which a concept belongs. Examples: apple – ORANGE; oak – ELM.
- *Subordinate [T-SUBORD]*: A category one level below the target concept in a taxonomy. Examples: chair – ROCKING CHAIR; TREE FROG.
- *Individual [T-INDIV]*. A specific instance of a concept. Examples: car – MY CAR; house – MY PARENTS’ HOUSE.

Situation Properties: A property of a situation, where a situation typically includes one or more agents, at some place and time, engaging in an event, with one or more entities in various semantic roles (e.g., picnic, conversation, vacation, meal).

- *Time [S-TIME]*: A time period associated with a situation or with one of its properties. When an event is used as a time, code the event as S-event. Examples: picnic – FOURTH OF JULY; sled – DURING THE WINTER.
- *Action [S-ACTION]*: An action (not introspective) that an agent (human or nonhuman) performs intentionally in a situation. When the action is chronic and/or characteristic of the entity, use E-beh. Examples: shirt – WEAR; apple – EAT; church – WEDDING.
- *Event [S-EVENT]*: A stand-alone event or activity in a situation where the action is not foregrounded but is on a relatively equal par with the setting, agents, entities, etc. (e.g., watermelon–PICNIC, car–TRIP; church–WEDDING). Use S-action when the action is foregrounded (e.g., use S-EVENT for church–MARRY vs. but use S-ACTION for church–WEDDING). Examples: muffin – BREAKFAST; watermelon – PICNIC; car – TRIP.
- *Function [S-FUNC]*: A typical goal or role that an entity serves for an agent in a situation by virtue of its physical properties with respect to relevant actions. Examples: car – TRANSPORTATION; clothing – PROTECTION.
- *Manner [S-MANNER]*. The manner in which an action or event is performed in a situation. Typically the modification of an action in terms of its quantity, duration, style, etc. Code the action itself as S-ACTION, S-EVENT or E-BEH. Examples: watermelon – SLOPPY; eating; car – FASTER than walking.
- *Physical state [S-PHYST]*. A physical state of a situation or any of its components except entities whose states are coded with E-SYS, and social organizations whose states are coded with S-SOCST. Examples: mountains – DAMP; highway – CONGESTED.
- *Social state [S-SOCST]*. A state of a social organization in a situation. Examples: family – COOPERATIVE; people – FREE.
- *Quantity [S-QUANT]*. A numerosity, frequency, intensity or typicality of a situation or any of its properties except of an entity, whose quantitative aspects are coded with E-QUANT. Examples: vacation – lasted for EIGHT days; car – a LONG drive.

Entity Properties: Properties of a concrete entity, either animate or inanimate. Besides being a single self-contained object, an entity can be a coherent collection of objects (e.g., forest).
- *External component [E-EXCOMP]*: A three-dimensional component of an entity that, at least to some extent, normally resides on its surface. Examples: car – HEADLIGHT; tree – LEAVES.
- *Internal component [E-INCOMP]*: A three-dimensional component of an entity that normally resides completely inside the closed surface of the entity. Examples: apple – SEEDS; jacket – LINING.
- *External surface property [E-EXSURF]*: An external property of an entity that is not a component, and that is perceived on or beyond the entity's surface, including shape, color, pattern, texture, touch, smell, taste, sound, etc. Examples: watermelon – OVAL; apple – RED.
- *Internal surface property [E-INSURF]*: An internal property of an entity that is not a component, that is not normally perceived on the entity’s exterior surface, and that is only perceived when the entity’s interior surface is exposed; includes color, pattern, texture, size, touch, smell, taste, etc. Examples: apple – WHITE; watermelon – JUICY.
- *Substance/Material [E-MAT]*: The material or substance of which something is made. Examples: floor – WOOD; shirt – CLOTH.

- *Larger whole [E-WHOLE]*: A whole to which an entity belongs. Examples: window – HOUSE; apple – TREE.
- *Entity behavior [E-BEH]*: A chronic behavior of an entity that is characteristic of its nature, and that is described as a characteristic property of the entity, not as a specific intentional action in a situation. Examples: tree – BLOWS IN THE WIND; bird – FLIES; person – EATS.
- *Abstract entity property [E-ABSTR]*. An abstract property of the target entity not dependent on a particular situation. Examples: teacher – DEMOCRAT; transplanted Californian – BUDDHIST.
- *Quantity [E-QUANT]*: A numerosity, frequency, size, intensity, or typicality of an entity or its properties. Examples: jacket – an ARTICLE of clothing; cat – FOUR legs; tree – LOTS of leaves; apple – COMMON fruit; watermelon – USUALLY green; apple – VERY red.

Introspective Properties: A property of a subject’s mental state as he or she views a situation, or a property of a character’s mental state in a situation.
- *Affect/emotion* [I-EMOT]*: An affective or emotional state toward the situation or one of its components by either the subject or a participant. Examples: magic – a sense of EXCITEMENT; vacation – I was HAPPY; smashed car – ANGER.
- *Evaluation [I-EVAL]*: A positive or negative evaluation of a situation or one of its components by the either the subject or a participant.Typically more about the situation or component than about the perceiver, often attributing a trait to it (e.g., BEAUTIFUL, COMMON). Use I-EMOT when the focus is more on the perceiver and on a traditional emotional state. Examples: apples – I LIKE them; vacation – I wrote a STUPID paper.
- *Representational state [I-REP]*: A relatively static or stable representational state in the mind of a situational participant, including beliefs, goals, desires, ideas, perceptions, etc. Examples: smashed car – BELIEVED it was not working; tree – WANTED to cut it down; tree—I had a good VIEW of a bird in it
- *Cognitive operation [I-COGOP]*: An online operation or process on a cognitive state, including retrieval, comparison, learning, etc.  Examples: watermelon – I REMEMBER a picnic; rolled grass – LOOKS LIKE a burrito; car – I LEARNED how to drive.
- *Contingency [I-CONTIN]*: A contingency between two or more aspects of a situation, including: conditionals and causals, such as if, enable, cause, because, becomes, underlies, depends, requires, etc.; correlations such as correlated, uncorrelated, negatively correlated, etc.; others including possession and means.
