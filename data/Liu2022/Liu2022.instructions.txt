You will be presented with a list of word pairs consisting of a cue and an associated target word separated by ' – '.

You are asked to choose a code with square brackets [] that best describes the semantic relation between the cue and the target word.
Each code refers to a specific semantic relation that refers to Taxonomic Relations, Concept Properties, Situation Properties, or Introspective Properties.

We will now provide you with a definition and examples for each of these, which you will carefully consider when choosing one of the codes.
